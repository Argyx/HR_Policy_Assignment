Fix Qdrant integration issues and ensure correct passage indexing

- **Changed point IDs in `upsert_embeddings_qdrant` function**:
  - Replaced string-based unique IDs (`document_p

assage_index`) with unsigned integer IDs (`idx`) to comply with Qdrant's requirement for point IDs to be unsigned integers or UUIDs.
  - Included the custom `unique_id` (combining `document` name and `passage_index`) in the payload for traceability.

- **Corrected parameter in `retrieve_and_verify_qdrant_data` function**:
  - Replaced the incorrect `scroll` parameter with `offset` in the `client.scroll` method to match the expected parameters of the `qdrant-client` library.
  - Updated variable names from `scroll` to `offset` for clarity.

- **Verified passage indices in Qdrant**:
  - Ensured that the passages stored in Qdrant match the original metadata by comparing `unique_id` and `passage` content.
  - Added messages to confirm successful verification or report mismatches.
